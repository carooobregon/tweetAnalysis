# tweetAnalysis
Final project for Intro to Databases class. In collaboration with Patricio Salazar and Francisco Salgado

This project was made with the intention of applying our knowledge of SQL in an application that deals with real-time data. We used Tweepy, a Python library to communicate with Twitterâ€™s API, and we were able to gather tweets about events and topics of our own interest to further analyze them using queries in SQL which we were able to reach very interesting insights about our respective subject matters.
